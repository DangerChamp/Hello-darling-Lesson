# Welcome to the Hello Darling Lesson! Remixed by ♥ GenesisGir ♥(っ◔◡◔)っ
 Are you new to learning python and coding? well so am I and this project and code is being given away to you to learn from and research on completely for beginners in this lesson you will learn basic skills and functions like print , len() , variables , values, integers , floating point values , str() , int() , float() , operators , input and etc. I'm only 7 days old in programming so far but if I can do it you can as well! with this building block remixed so you can view and take apart , rip , dissect and study you should be able to make little handy programs for fun or a hobby and push further with your craft of coding in python. we all have to start somewhere and this is how I'm learning! Also I highly recommend to do this with tandem with the website www.automatetheboring.com to better understand what's going on!

 # For more experienced coders too!
 If you been coding for a very long time watching someone start off can just be fun and not only you can contribute to the source code and enter you own remix of the code but also give feedback if something is wrong. with all the code aside we are building a community of people who come to together and work together

 # practice practice practice!
In my experience of coding thus far making mistakes are well. . .Fun! you get to figure out the code like a puzzle and se what needs to go where so if you get a syntax that's a welcoming challenge to discover more possibilities to explore. 

# Explore and enjoy
If your new please I can't stress this enough is to just sit down have a coffee or a drink and listen to music and enjoy the code and learn from it! stress will make you demotivated and trust me that's not good for ya!

# Remix & twist
This code is open source and any one can contribute to it and add there little idea's just pull request and I will review
