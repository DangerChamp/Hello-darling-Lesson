"""" This Program Teaches you some simple functions such as print , variables ,
input , len , str , int  functions hopefully you can gain some knowledge on this
script and get to understand why we do the things i've set for you to learn from!
make sure to read threw and see the comments preset for you to see what each line does!
it can be intimidating but is quite easy , make sure to follow me on twitch @GenesisGir and on GitHub
"""
print('Hello!') #This line is saying hello with the print() function
print() # when you use print() you can create empty lines like this one!
print('whats your name?') # asking the user their name with the print() function 
name=input() #im using the input function to take input from the user
print('oh why hello '+name+' its nice to meet darling!') # chatting with the user , we inserted the variable that the user set
print() # empty line using the print() function
print('This is how many characters are in your name!') # telling the user how many letters are in their name
print(len(name)) # the len function shows the amount of intergers inside the variable
print('So how old are you?') # using the pring function to type more text on screen
age=input() #input function takes users input 
print('wow! well guess what you will be ' + str(int(age) + 1) + ' in one year.') 
"""" in line 17 we are using the str , int functions for 2 things. the str function is converting
the interger into a string data type and the int function take the interger and converts 
floating data types into intergers! and the operators to add a new part of instruction to the command line.
"""
print() #this empty line is using the print() function to create space   
print('goodbye sweetheart!') #saying goodbye to the user using the print function
""""
And thats it! this is simple code that you can review and analze and study
and branch out and make your own as well! make sure to follow me @genesisgir on twitch
i do endless livestreams of my workflow and how i do things
coding is a world of creativity and diverse scripts that come together that make programs
